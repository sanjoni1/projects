# **Impact of EdTech on College Students**
## **Abstract**
This project analyzes the impact of EdTech on college students, focusing on their
preferences, challenges, and effectiveness in enhancing learning and career readiness. We
collected data from various college students living in Delhi and Kolkata, asking questions
designed to gauge their attitude towards various factors regarding Educational Technology that
may have a possible impact on college students. For this project, those factors were: students'
general attitude regarding their preferences for modern learning tools vs. traditional learning
tools, the effect of the pandemic regarding their preferences for modern learning, and their
inclination to use modern learning tools regarding job preparation. The results aim to provide
actionable insights into how students perceive EdTech and what improvements can better support
them in education and career preparation.
## **Introduction**
With the exponential increase in the use of technology over the past few years, it is no
surprise that the use of it has expanded to the field of education. Education technology refers to
the usage of digital tools, platforms, and technologies to enhance teaching, learning, and
educational management. “The global education technology market size was estimated at USD
142.37 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.4% from 2024 to 2030. EdTech
includes hardware and software technology used to educate students on a virtual level to improve
learning in classrooms and enhance students’ education outcomes.” 

Starting with the survey, we collected data from various college students living in Delhi
and Kolkata, asking questions designed to gauge their attitude towards various aspects of
Educational Technology that may have a possible impact on college students. For this project,
those factors were: students' general attitude regarding their preferences for modern learning
tools vs. traditional learning tools, the effect of the pandemic regarding their preferences for
modern learning, and their inclination to use modern learning tools regarding job preparation.
The data collection was done through a survey via Google Forms. The descriptive analysis was
done through Power BI and the inferential analysis through Excel.

The purpose of this project is to offer valuable insights to educational institutions, policymakers,
and EdTech providers, helping them enhance learning experiences and address the specific needs
of students in these cities.
## **Project Objective**
- To study the impact of EdTech on college students through survey and analysis.
- The survey was conducted in the cities of Delhi and Kolkata, with the target audience
being college students residing in those cities. To test the hypothesis: “Is there a
relationship between students' city (Delhi vs. Kolkata) and their preference for EdTech
tools?” and “Is there a relationship between students' field of study (Engineering vs.
Non-Engineering) and their preference for EdTech tools?”
- Analyze college students' attitudes towards traditional vs. modern learning methods in
Delhi and Kolkata.
- Identify the challenges faced by students when using EdTech, such as financial or
technical barriers.
- Assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on students’ adoption of EdTech tools.
- Gauge the role of EdTech in developing job skills and preparing students for the job
market.
- Provide insights for institutions and policymakers to improve the effectiveness of EdTech
in higher education.
## **Methodology**
- Define the target population: College students residing in Delhi or Kolkata.
- Identify possible factors that impact the students and can be gauged via the survey:
Traditional vs. Modern Learning, Impact of COVID-19 pandemic, and Using EdTech to
develop job skills.
- Create the survey: 3 definitive questions and 6 questions per factor to be studied.
- The survey was then circulated through both cities from 8th October to 22nd October,
garnering a total of 92 responses. 54 from Delhi, 34 from Kolkata, and 4 from other
cities.
- The data collected was then analyzed via general sentiment as well as city-wise.
- *Descriptive Analysis:*
  - Using Power BI, the data was cleaned and preprocessed using queries in the
transform data section. (Transform>Trim and Transform>lowercase.)
  - The 4 multiple choice questions responses were separated and were counted as
one response for each option. (E.g. If someone stated that they learned technical skills and problem-solving skills, their response was added to both counts.) (Split
column> By delimiter ‘comma’>different rows.)
     The cleaned data was then made into a data visual for each question.
- *Inferential Analysis:*
  - Hypothesis testing: “City and preference are independent variables.” Using Excel.
    - Created pivot table of city and preference.
    - Calculated expected value using Excel
    - Calculated chi-square value using Excel
    - Fond p-value to test the fit of the hypothesis
  - Hypothesis testing: “Field of study and preference are independent variables.”

## **Conclusion**
From this report, we have concluded that college students from both Delhi and Kolkata have a
preference for a hybrid mode of education, and there is no significant relation between the cities
and the responses. However, while both have a preference for hybrid mode, there is a
relationship between the field of study and preference. We also conclude that the pandemic made
students prefer EdTech and that modern technology greatly helped them continue their education
during the pandemic. We also concluded that students rely on EdTech for job preparation and
skill enhancement.

It is also important to keep in mind the limitations of this survey, starting with the fact that a
majority of the responses are from an engineering background and that we have already proven
that the field of study affects their preferences. It should also be noted that the survey pool was
not truly random. Finally, it should be noted that financial background and other relevant factors
were not taken into account while conducting the survey. This survey will be beneficial for
various companies who work on Edtech like Coursera Inc., BYJU’S, and various other
educational platforms in understanding the mindset of students regarding Edtech and making a
better version of it, keeping the various disadvantages identified in the survey. It could also help
education policymakers take into account what students feel is most helpful in their education,
and attempt to make the consequent changes. As per the survey, the next step is to take measures
to have college education taken into a hybrid mode of modern and traditional classes.
